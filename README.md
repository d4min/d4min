## 👋 Hi, I'm Danish
Data Engineer with a passion for building robust pipelines and solving interesting problems. I enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights, and occasionally dabble in side projects that keep my coding skills sharp.

## 🌱 I'm currently working on
- **DataCanary**: A personal project I'm developing to explore data quality monitoring concepts - it helps identify anomalies and potential issues in datasets before they cause problems downstream
- **Letterboxd-Wrapped**: Spotify Wrapped for film lovers—visualising your Letterboxd history with personalised analytics and shareable insights
- **Student-Learning-Classifier**: An MVP using AI to classify maths students' learning styles and recommend tailored resources based on engagement data.
