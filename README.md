## 👋 Hi, I'm Danish
Data Engineer with a passion for building robust pipelines and solving interesting problems. I enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights, and occasionally dabble in side projects that keep my coding skills sharp.

## 🌱 I'm currently working on
- **DataCanary**: A personal project I'm developing to explore data quality monitoring concepts - it helps identify anomalies and potential issues in datasets before they cause problems downstream
- **AirCanvas**: An experiment with computer vision that lets you draw in the air using hand gestures tracked by your webcam
- **Go-Monkey-Interpreter**: An interpreter written in Go that helps me understand language design and implementation
