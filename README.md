## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Danish
Data Engineer with a passion for building robust pipelines and solving interesting problems. I enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights, and occasionally dabble in side projects that keep my coding skills sharp.

## ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on
- **DataCanary**: A personal project I'm developing to explore data quality monitoring concepts - it helps identify anomalies and potential issues in datasets before they cause problems downstream
- **Letterboxd-Wrapped**: Spotify Wrapped for film loversâ€”visualising your Letterboxd history with personalised analytics and shareable insights
- **Go-Monkey-Interpreter**: An interpreter written in Go that helps me understand language design and implementation
